 GWT-Google Web Toolkit
 GWT is a framework to build large scale and high performance web appliation while keeping them as easy-to-maintain.
  Provide option to write client side applications in java
  Compiles the java written code into javascript

GWT generates optimized javascript code, produces browser's specific javascript code by self.

Disadvantages Of GWT:
Not Indexable − 
Web pages generated by GWT would not be indexed by search engines because these applications are generated dynamically.

Not Degradable − 
If your application user disables Javascript then user will just see the basic page and nothing more.

Not Designer's Friendly − 
GWT is not suitable for web designers who prefer using plain HTML with placeholders for inserting dynamic content at later point in tim


GWT components:
1)GWT java to JS compiler
  Used to convert application code written in java to js
2)JRE emulation library
  GWT includes the library that emulates(similar to) subsets of java runtime library
3)GWT UI building library
  this part of gwt include many parts for bulding UI component,RPC support,History Management

GWT has four important parts as its application structure
  First three are mandatory last one is optional
  1.Module Descripters
  2.Public Resources
  3.Client Side Code
  4.Server Side Code

----->Detailed
Module Descriptors
Location:
  ""src/com/tutorialspoint/HelloWorld.gwt.xml""
  :These are the configuration files in xml format
This provides name of the application.
 

To build the GWT Applications 
  there are total four sections in designing the a GWT app
  1) Module Descriptor
  2)UI design
  3)Client Side Programming 
  4)Server Side Programming

1]Module Descriptor
   These are the configuration files in xml format
   Syntax for naming the file:
   name.gwt.xml where name is application name

2]Ui design 
   These are all the HTML,CSS and images files used to design GWT files 
   WE can configure its location in the module Descriptor using the <public path = "location address" /> tag 

3]Clinet side code: In this section consist all the codes and business logic of the application that is converted into js.
   We can find the location of the resource file <source path = "path" /> tag
   These code consist of entry point code which can be written without parameter.
   GWT module is loaded each time as EntryPoint.onModuleLoad() method is called.
   
4]Server side code 
   is option as if we dont have any backend or server side database
